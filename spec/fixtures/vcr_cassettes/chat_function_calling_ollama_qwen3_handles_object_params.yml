        let''s tackle this user query. The user wants me to call the object_params
        tool with a window starting on 2025-01-01 and ending on 2025-01-02. First,
        I need to check the function''s parameters. The function requires a \"window\"
        object, which should have start and end dates.\n\nLooking at the tool''s definition,
        the \"window\" is an object with a description about the time window. The
        parameters for the function are in the \"properties\" section, specifying
        that \"window\" is required. So, I need to structure the arguments correctly.\n\nThe
        user provided start and end dates, so I''ll create a JSON object with those
        dates. The start is \"2025-01-01\" and the end is \"2025-01-02\". I''ll format
        the arguments as a JSON object inside the tool_call tags. Let me make sure
        the keys are correct, like \"start\" and \"end\" under the \"window\" object.
        \n\nWait, the function''s parameters are under the \"window\" property. So
        the arguments should be {\"window\": {\"start\": \"2025-01-01\", \"end\":
        \"2025-01-02\"}}. That should match the required structure. I''ll double-check
        the function''s required parameters to ensure I''m not missing anything. Yep,
        \"window\" is required, and the example seems correct. Alright, time to put
        it all together in the tool_call format.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_uecnc144","index":0,"type":"function","function":{"name":"object_params","arguments":"{\"window\":{\"end\":\"2025-01-02\",\"start\":\"2025-01-01\"}}"}}]},"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":179,"completion_tokens":378,"total_tokens":557}}
