        creator of the programming language **Ruby** is **Yukihiro Matsumoto**, commonly
        known by his nickname **\"Matz\"**. He developed Ruby in the mid-1990s, with
        the first version (Ruby 0.2) released in 1995. Matsumoto designed Ruby with
        a focus on simplicity, productivity, and a clean, readable syntax. His goal
        was to create a language that balanced power with ease of use, which has made
        Ruby popular for web development (e.g., through frameworks like Ruby on Rails)
        and other applications. \n\n**Key points:**\n- **Name:** Yukihiro Matsumoto\n-
        **Nickname:** Matz\n- **Year of creation:** 1995\n- **Goal:** A language that
        is both powerful and easy to use, emphasizing developer happiness and productivity.\n\nMatsumoto
        is still actively involved in the Ruby community and continues to contribute
        to its development.","reasoning_content":"\nOkay, so I need to find out who
        created the programming language Ruby. Let me start by recalling what I know
        about Ruby. I remember that Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming
        language known for its simplicity and productivity. It''s often used for web
        development, especially with frameworks like Ruby on Rails. But I''m not sure
        about the creator''s name.\n\nI think the creator might be a Japanese person.
        I recall hearing that Ruby was created by someone from Japan. Maybe Yukihiro
        Matsumoto? Wait, I''ve heard the name Matsumoto before in relation to Ruby.
        Let me check if that''s correct. \n\nI should also consider other possibilities.
        Are there any other people associated with Ruby''s creation? I don''t think
        so. I remember that Matsumoto is sometimes referred to as \"Matz\" in the
        Ruby community. That''s a nickname he uses. So, putting it all together, the
        creator is Yukihiro Matsumoto, also known as Matz. \n\nBut wait, I should
        make sure there''s no confusion with other languages or people. For example,
        there''s a language called Ruby that''s different from the one I''m thinking
        of? No, I think Ruby is the correct one. Also, I don''t think there''s another
        person with a similar name who created Ruby. \n\nAnother way to verify is
        to think about the timeline. Ruby was first released in 1995. If Matsumoto
        created it, he would have been working on it around that time. I think he
        started developing Ruby in the mid-90s. \n\nI can also recall that Matsumoto''s
        goal was to create a language that was easy to use and had a clean syntax.
        That aligns with Ruby''s design principles. So, combining all these points,
        I''m fairly confident that Yukihiro Matsumoto is the creator of Ruby.\n","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1762113749,"id":"chatcmpl-X1D9aIb8fpY1Su2GZIQJsj68UNn6m8ij","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":583,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":384,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":18,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_per_second":424.9392100852239,"time_per_output_token_ms":8.211902229845625,"time_to_first_token_ms":42.359,"tokens_per_second":121.77446491819701,"total_tokens":601}}'

        the user just asked, \"What year did he create Ruby?\" So, I need to recall
        the information from the previous conversation. Earlier, I mentioned that
        Yukihiro Matsumoto, or Matz, created Ruby in the mid-1990s, with the first
        version released in 1995. The user is now specifically asking for the year.\n\nWait,
        the initial answer said the first version was released in 1995. But I should
        double-check if that''s accurate. I remember that Ruby 0.2 was the first version,
        and it was released in 1995. However, some sources might mention the year
        as 1993 or 1994 when Matsumoto started working on it. But the official release
        date is 1995. \n\nThe user might be looking for the exact year, so I need
        to confirm. Let me think. Matsumoto started developing Ruby in 1993, but the
        first public release was in 1995. So the answer should be 1995 as the year
        of creation, even though development began earlier. \n\nAlso, the user might
        be interested in the exact timeline, so it''s important to clarify that the
        first version was released in 1995. I should make sure not to confuse the
        start of development with the official release. \n\nAnother thing to consider:
        the user might be a student or someone learning about programming languages,
        so providing a clear and concise answer is key. They might not need the nuances
        of development vs. release, but just the year. \n\nSo, the answer is 1995.
        I should state that the first version of Ruby was released in 1995. Maybe
        add a note about the development starting in 1993 if needed, but the user''s
        question is specifically about the creation year, which is 1995. \n\nI need
        to ensure that the answer is accurate and directly addresses the question
        without unnecessary details. The user might be testing if I remember the exact
        year, so confirming 1995 is crucial.\n","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1762113753,"id":"chatcmpl-pwkLB0Vn5M0mkSBSCozsbVdjmwCeY2xT","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":526,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":444,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":231,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":16},"prompt_tokens_per_second":4501.169134840218,"time_per_output_token_ms":8.320528517110265,"time_to_first_token_ms":51.32,"tokens_per_second":120.18467311825304,"total_tokens":757}}'
