        think. The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself,
        gives the original number. So, I need to find a number that when squared equals
        64.\n\nLet me recall basic math. 8 times 8 is 64, right? Yes, 8 squared is
        64. But wait, there''s also -8, because negative numbers squared also give
        positive results. However, when people ask for the square root, they usually
        refer to the principal (positive) root. So the answer should be 8.\n\nThe
        user wants the answer in a JSON object with the key \"result\". So I need
        to structure it as {\"result\": 8}. Let me double-check to make sure I didn''t
        make a mistake. Yep, 8 is correct. No other numbers squared give 64. Alright,
        that''s the answer.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":230,"completion_tokens":7,"total_tokens":237}}
