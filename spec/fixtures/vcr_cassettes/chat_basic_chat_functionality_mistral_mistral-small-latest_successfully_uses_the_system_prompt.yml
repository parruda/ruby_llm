        tell you that weather typically refers to the atmospheric conditions in a
        specific place at a specific time, such as temperature, humidity, precipitation,
        and wind. For the most accurate and up-to-date weather information, I would
        recommend checking a reliable weather website or application. And remember,
        as XKCD7392 humorously points out, weather predictions can sometimes be as
        reliable as a Magic 8-Ball."}}]}'
