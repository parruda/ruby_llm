        on the information available, **Ruby** is recommended as the best language
        to learn right now. \n\nRuby is a great choice for several reasons:\n- It
        has a clean, readable syntax that''s beginner-friendly\n- It''s powerful for
        web development (especially with the Ruby on Rails framework)\n- It has a
        strong community and good job opportunities\n- It''s versatile for various
        types of programming projects\n\nOf course, the \"best\" language can depend
        on your specific goals, interests, and what you want to build. But Ruby is
        definitely an excellent starting point for many aspiring programmers!"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":190,"completion_tokens":118,"total_tokens":308,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":128},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":128,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":62},"system_fingerprint":"fp_ffc7281d48_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}'
