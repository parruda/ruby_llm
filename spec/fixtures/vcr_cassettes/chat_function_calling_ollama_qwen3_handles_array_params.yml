        the user wants me to call the array_params tool with the tags [\"red\", \"blue\"]
        and combine them. Let me check the function definition. The function requires
        an array of strings under the \"tags\" parameter. Since the user provided
        exactly that, I just need to structure the tool call correctly. The combined
        tags would be the array elements joined, maybe with a separator? Wait, the
        function''s description says it uses the params DSL array support, so maybe
        it''s just passing the array as is. The user probably expects the output to
        be \"red, blue\" or similar. I''ll make sure to format the JSON arguments
        properly with the tags array.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_jps0v70w","index":0,"type":"function","function":{"name":"array_params","arguments":"{\"tags\":[\"red\",\"blue\"]}"}}]},"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":168,"completion_tokens":163,"total_tokens":331}}
