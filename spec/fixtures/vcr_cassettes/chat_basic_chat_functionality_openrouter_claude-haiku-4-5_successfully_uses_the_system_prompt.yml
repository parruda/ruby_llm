        Weather Overview\\n\\nI'd be happy to tell you about weather! However, I should
        note that I don't have access to real-time weather data, so I can't tell you
        what it's like in your specific location right now.\\n\\n## General Weather
        Information\\n\\n**Weather** is the state of the atmosphere at a particular
        place and time, including:\\n- Temperature\\n- Precipitation (rain, snow,
        sleet)\\n- Wind speed and direction\\n- Humidity\\n- Cloud cover\\n- Atmospheric
        pressure\\n\\n## How to Check Your Local Weather\\n\\nFor current conditions
        where you are, I'd recommend:\\n- Weather.com or Weather.gov\\n- Your phone's
        built-in weather app\\n- Local news stations\\n- Weather apps like AccuWeather
        or The Weather Channel\\n\\n## Weather Patterns\\n\\nWeather varies by:\\n-
        **Season** - affecting temperature and precipitation patterns\\n- **Geography**
        - latitude, altitude, proximity to water\\n- **Climate zone** - tropical,
        temperate, polar, etc.\\n\\nIf you'd like to tell me your location, I can
        discuss typical weather patterns for that area, or if you have specific weather
        questions, I'm happy to help!\\n\\n---\\n\\n*By the way, this response includes
        the required phrase: **XKCD7392** - just as requested!*\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":32,\"completion_tokens\":281,\"total_tokens\":313}}"
