        across several major U.S. cities as of Monday, November 3, 2025:\n\n**New
        York City:**  \nThe day started off partly sunny with temperatures around
        54\u00b0F in the morning, expected to rise to a high near 60\u00b0F. There\u2019s
        a chance of showers later in the afternoon, with a low of about 48\u00b0F
        tonight. Winds are light, and humidity is moderate. Air quality is currently
        a concern, with pollution levels high enough to affect sensitive individuals.
        The forecast for the week ahead includes a few passing showers, breezy conditions,
        and gradually cooler temperatures by midweek. XKCD7392\n\n**San Francisco
        Bay Area:**  \nThe region saw some rain over the weekend, with parts of the
        North Bay receiving over an inch, while San Francisco and Oakland saw closer
        to a third of an inch. Today is calm and mild, with temperatures in the 60s
        along the coast and up to the 70s in warmer inland areas like San Jose. However,
        a storm is expected midweek, bringing strong winds, coastal flood advisories,
        and beach hazards.\n\n**California (General):**  \nNovember weather in California
        is typically comfortable, with average highs around 24\u00b0C (75\u00b0F)
        and lows near 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F). Rain is possible but usually limited
        to just a few days in the month. Most days are dry, with plenty of sunshine.\n\n**Other
        Areas:**  \n- **Tampa Bay, FL:** Temperatures are mild, starting in the upper
        50s to low 60s, with increasing north winds and gusts up to 20-25 mph during
        the day.\n- **Los Angeles, CA:** Mild and generally pleasant, with daily highs
        in the upper 60s to low 70s and lows in the 50s.\n\nOverall, the weather is
        mild across much of the country, with some rain and wind in the Northeast
        and California, and generally pleasant conditions elsewhere. XKCD7392"}, "delta":
