        capital of France is **Paris**. It is a major cultural, economic, and political
        center in Europe, renowned for landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre
        Museum, and the Seine River.","reasoning_content":"\nOkay, the user is asking
        for the capital of France. Let me think. I know that France is a country in
        Europe, and the capital is a well-known city. I remember that Paris is the
        capital of France. But wait, I should make sure I''m not confusing it with
        another country. For example, the capital of Italy is Rome, and the capital
        of Spain is Madrid. So, France''s capital is definitely Paris. I should also
        confirm that there are no other cities that might be considered as capitals.
        Sometimes, countries have multiple capitals, but France is a single country,
        so it has one capital. Paris is the political, economic, and cultural center
        of France. I think that''s right. Maybe I can mention that Paris is also known
        for its landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum. But the user
        just asked for the capital, so the answer should be straightforward. Let me
        double-check by recalling some geography facts. Yes, Paris is the capital.
        I don''t think there''s any other city that''s considered the capital. So
        the answer is Paris.\n","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1762178201,"id":"chatcmpl-mTjuO2sBreGeUQG4LjimRtla42FKdfpz","model":"qwen3","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":272,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":224,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0},"draft_tokens":0,"draft_tokens_acceptance":0.0,"prompt_tokens":15,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":3},"prompt_tokens_per_second":1039.9334442595675,"time_per_output_token_ms":8.04039705882353,"time_to_first_token_ms":14.424,"tokens_per_second":124.37196729017262,"total_tokens":287}}'
