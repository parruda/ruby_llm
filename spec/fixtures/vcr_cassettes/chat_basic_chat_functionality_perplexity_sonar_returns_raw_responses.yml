        commercial, and political center[1][2][3][4][5]. Historically, Paris became

        status, except during the German occupation in World War II when the capital
        was temporarily moved[2][6].\n\nParis is well known for its rich history,
        iconic landmarks, and role as a global center for finance, culture, fashion,
        and gastronomy[3][4]. It is part of the \u00cele-de-France region and has
