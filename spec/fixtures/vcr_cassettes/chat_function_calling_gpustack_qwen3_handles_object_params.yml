        the user wants me to call the object_params function with a window starting
        on 2025-01-01 and ending on 2025-01-02. Let me check the function''s parameters.
        The function requires a \"window\" object with \"start\" and \"end\" as required
        fields. Both should be ISO strings. The user provided the dates in the correct
        format, so I just need to structure the JSON accordingly. No additional properties
        are allowed, so I''ll make sure the object only includes the window with those
        dates.
