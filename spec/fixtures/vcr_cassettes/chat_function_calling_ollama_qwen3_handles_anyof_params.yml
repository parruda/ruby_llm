        let me tackle this user query. The user wants me to call the any_of_params
        function for the task \"Review PR\" with status \"pending\" and report the
        result.\n\nFirst, I need to check the function''s parameters. The function
        requires \"task\" and \"status\". The \"status\" field has an anyOf definition:
        it can be a string from the enum [\"pending\", \"done\"] or null. Since the
        user provided \"pending\", that''s valid. The task is \"Review PR\", which
        is a string, so that''s fine.\n\nI should structure the tool call with these
        parameters. The arguments should be a JSON object with \"task\" and \"status\".
        No other parameters are needed. I need to make sure the JSON is correctly
        formatted. Let me double-check the required fields and the enum values. Everything
        seems in order. So the tool call should be correct.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_eje5i1o4","index":0,"type":"function","function":{"name":"any_of_params","arguments":"{\"status\":\"pending\",\"task\":\"Review
