However, it notes that some files in the distribution are not under these terms and refers to a `LEGAL` file for their specific conditions.\n*   **Generated Files:** Scripts and library files *produced by* or *supplied as input to* Ruby do not automatically fall under this copyright; they belong to whoever generated them and can be sold commercially.\n*   **No Warranty:** The software is provided \"AS IS,\" without any express or implied warranties, including merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose."
